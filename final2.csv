guitarwarrior,4.0 ,"January 5, 2019",USA,R31QHSMQT58S2Z,B07B47WHCC,AE5D6UZUC6JD55ZAWHV37J5W4AHA,our family chose this flavor because we all love garlic. some found the garlic intensity a little weak but it was perfect for my taste. the jerky itself was chewy but not too hard. we like the smaller packages because we don't feel the need to consume the entire product within a few days.,tasty. will try other flavors next.
